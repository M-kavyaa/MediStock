# 💊 MediStock

An inventory management system for **Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Kendras** that streamlines medicine inventory, sales, and inter-kendra stock transfers while reducing medicine wastage through **FEFO (First Expiry First Out)** inventory management.

---

## 📌 Overview

MediStock is a full-stack web application developed to improve inventory operations across Jan Aushadhi Kendras. The system enables administrators and shopkeepers to manage medicine stock efficiently through role-based access, batch-wise inventory tracking, FEFO-based sales, and intelligent transfer recommendations.

The primary objective is to minimize medicine expiry, prevent stock shortages, and simplify inventory management.

## 🗄 Database

Current database contains the following modules:

- Kendras
- Users
- Medicines
- Inventory
- Sales
- Transfers

The system maintains relationships between medicines, batches, inventory, sales transactions, and transfer records.

---

## 🔄 FEFO Logic

Medicines are always sold from the earliest **non-expired** batch.

If the required quantity is not available in a single batch, MediStock automatically distributes the sale across multiple eligible batches while maintaining transactional consistency.

Expired batches are never considered for sales.

---

## 🚛 Transfer Recommendation Logic

The recommendation engine analyzes inventory across Jan Aushadhi Kendras and prioritizes transfers based on:

- Near-expiry medicines
- Low-stock kendras
- Excess inventory
- District-level prioritization

The generated recommendations are reviewed and approved by the administrator before execution.
